# Teaching Experience at the University of Debrecen

As a demonstrator at the University of Debrecen, I had the opportunity to assist students in two programming courses: **Programming Languages 1** and **Programming Languages 2**. Below is an overview of each course and my role in helping students develop their programming skills.

## Programming Languages 1 (C)

**University of Debrecen**  
**February 2024 - May 2024**  
**Course Language:** C

### Course Description
Programming Languages 1 focused on introducing students to fundamental programming concepts and structures using the C programming language. The course covered essential topics such as:
- Basic syntax and structure of C
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays, pointers, and memory management
- Basic data structures

### My Role
As a demonstrator for this course, I provided support to students by:
- Conducting regular consultations to clarify concepts and answer questions.
- Offering individual assistance and mentoring to students who required extra help.
- Collecting feedback from students and faculty to continually improve the course content and teaching methods.

## Programming Languages 2 (Java)

**University of Debrecen**  
**September 2024 - Present**  
**Course Language:** Java

### Course Description
Programming Languages 2 builds upon the foundations laid in the previous course, introducing students to object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. Key topics included:
- Object-oriented principles (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Exception handling
- Java libraries and utilities
- Basic GUI development in Java
- Data structures and algorithms

### My Role
In my role as a demonstrator for this course, I helped students develop a deeper understanding of Java programming by:
- Assisting students with exercises and lab sessions, ensuring they grasped key concepts.
- Providing one-on-one support and mentoring, addressing individual challenges and queries.
- Collecting and analyzing feedback from students to adapt the course and improve its effectiveness.
